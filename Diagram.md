Document your domain

Create domain model

Biggest power that comes from domain modeling is the collaboration

Documenting the important steps with diagram

Domain modeling is the primary way of determining the important aspects of a business.

Created collaboratively by engineering, product, and business stakeholders to ensure all major parts of the business are aligned on what the domain model looks like.

Landed on a culmination of a few different ideas and were able to easily translate the domain model into code

Ability to allow your domain and code to evolve over time
As we’re all speaking the same language, and the code flows easily because we have a clear idea of how we should represent these business requirements using our domain model.

Reference it at any point
It’s very common for new requirements to come along later

Brings everyone on the journey and ultimately to the same destination
