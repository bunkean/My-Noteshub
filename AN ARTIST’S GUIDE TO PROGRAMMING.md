# AUTHOR’S NOTE
Processing is:
- A programming ==language==
- ==Designed== by Casey Reas and Ben Fry
- Used by artists creating ==generative== art
- ==Based== on Java
- ==Extends== Java in many useful ways:
  - Read, display, and write ==image files==
  - Drawing elementary ==shapes and curves==
  - ==Manipulating== colors
  - It opens a window into which the programmer/artist will ==draw==
  - All Processing programs are intended to create an image, a ==visual output==
# INTRODUCTION
The Basics of a Programming Language: Processing:
  - When someone programs a computer => they are really communicating with it:
    - **Imperative**
      - Because the computer has ==no choice==
      - It is being told ==what to do==
      - It will ==do exactly== that
>>>>**Precise**
>>>>>Does not apply any ==interpretation== to what it is being told.
>>>>>
>>>>>Computers ==do not think== and so can’t evaluate a command that would amount to “expose the patient to a fatal dose of radiation” with any skepticism.
>>>>>
>>>>>So we, as programmers, must be ==careful and precise== in what we instruct the machine to do.

- When humans communicate with each other, we use a language.
  - Similarly, humans use languages to communicate with computers, but these languages are
    - _artificial_ (humans invented them for this purpose),
    - _terse_ (there are few if any modifiers—no way to express emotions or gradations of any feeling),
    - precise (each item in the language means one thing), and
    - _written_ (we do not yet speak to computers in a programming language).
- The process of programming begins with a problem to be solved, and the first step is to ==state== the problem as clearly as possible.
- Then we ==analyze== the problem and ==determine== methods by which it may be solved.
  - Computers can only directly ==manipulate== numbers, so it is common for solutions discussed at this stage to be numerical or mathematical.
- A sketch of the solution, perhaps on paper in a human language and math, is created.
- The resulting text file is called a ==script, source code, or more commonly the computer program==.
- Next, another program called a compiler takes the program and converts it into a form that ==can be executed on the computer==.
- Basically, all programs are converted into ==machine code==, which consists of numbers, and which the computer can execute.
